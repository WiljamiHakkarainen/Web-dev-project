          <h1>The purpose of this website</h1>
          <p>This website is a project that has taught me how to get better at web development. It includes some HTML for structure, some JavaScript for dynamic elements and some CSS for the navigation bar and general styling. </p>
          <h2>The Structure</h2>
          <p>This is the Home page of my website. You can navigate to the other pages via the navigation bar. There are 3 pages in total.</p>
          <p>The playground page consists of a few interesting and dynamic features to pass the time.</p>
          <p>In the About page you can find all the relevant information about the creator and the project itself.</p>
